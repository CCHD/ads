If you’re UNIX/Linux/Mac OS user, you can compile the p4.c into executable file ‘p4’ using the terminal with ‘make’ under the directory ‘code’.
If you’re Windows OS user, you can just double click the ‘p4.exe’ to run the program, or you may use IDE to compile the ‘p4.c’.

The directory ‘test’ is used to test the time complexity. Like above, you can run it according to your OS. It tests the running time of different amount of the number of input numbers on average.
